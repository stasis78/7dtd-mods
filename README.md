This is a collection of very basic mods that I used to always apply by hand. Thanks to the awesome new xpath modlet system, I no longer need to do that!

## Mod Info

### AugerMod

Makes the auger one shot stone after you get some strength and/or miner69 perks. Increases wood damage so you can 1-2 shot trees. Also increases the gas tank to a reasonable size.

### AugerNoKickMod

Removes kickback from auger.

### ShutUpAugerMod

This just replaces the loud parts of the auger with a quiet sound. The idle sound is still there which isn't annoying. Probably breaks a lot of the sound based heat map stuff...

### TripleThreatPointMod

3 points for perks per level.

### StackSizeMod

Stack size changes/remaps the following:

- 1000 -> 10,000 (i.e. gas cans)
- 6000 -> 10,000 (i.e. wood stacks)
- iron frags -> 10,000

### MoreStrippersMod

Add more strippers to some of the game. You will see them more often. :lulz:

### WeedwhackerMod

Its just a stone axe that attacks really fast and far away...

### FlatWorldMod 

Not really a completely flat world. It just makes things "a bit more flat".

### StoneResourcesMod

Gives brass, lead, oil shale, potassium, and coal from stone blocks.

### StrongerSteelMod

Make steel lighter and stronger. Still can't overcome the 15 block SI limit..

### FasterMovementMod

You'll move really really fast now.

### MostExcellentStartMod

Start with: auger, chainsaw, machete! and some other stuff.

### WhatTheHayMod

Infinite fall height onto hay bale with no damage.

### ThreadMasterMod

Adds recipes for existing items to the game. Contains examples of how to require a crafting tool or crafting area for these recipes.

### ChainsawMod

Increase damage to wood. Double wood harvest amount. Massive increase to entity damage. Saw up those zeds.

### SteelGarageDoorMod

Adds a new steel tier to garage door with 3 levels, just like the iron version. Simply build a regular metal garage door and upgrade it. Inherits the Msteel material so it is very strong like the vault doors and stuff.

### PickupSeedsMod

Lets you pick up seeds, instead of punching them on accident. 

### BetterHoeMod 

Made to compliment PickupSeedsMod. The hoe now has a much smaller attack range, but attacks much faster. With this change you can simply walk along with left mouse button down, and harvest crops without damaging the soil.

When used with PickupSeedsMod, you never have to worry about seeds being removed :)

### FastGrowFarmingMod

For debugging farming, accelerates plant growth timers.

### AlternateSourcesRecipeMod

Adds some extra recipes for alternate sources.

- Duct Tap (Tar cloth)
- Tar (Pine Resin) *chemistry station required*

- Questionable Meat (meatx2) 15% chance of sickness but gain more health and stam
- Iron Arrow (scrap iron, wood, feather) *workbench required*
- Military Fiber (cloth) *workbench required*
- Early forge (a lot more stone and clay) *workbench required*

Get Pine Resin from any "Pine" tree in the game.

### FarmLifeMod

Adds growable plants and new recipes to craft.

### WayneBradyMod

Strippers now give wayyyyy to much experience points. But its worth it when they haven't brought home that dough.

### CheaperIronMod

Gives you 5x forged iron/steel when crafting at the forge. 

### BetterCraftingMod

This is not a cheat mod! Adds recipes for cement, cobblestone, concrete mix, crushed sand, gun powder. They are balanced identically to vanilla recipes. They take 100 times the materials and create 100 times the output. End server lag!

### PolishedSteelMod

Adds a bunch of stainless steel upgrades to steel blocks and downgrade stainless steel to steel. Not my fault if pimps remove stainless steel blocks in a future release and this break s***.

### RailGunMod

Add the following new items:

- Railgun (uses AK texture for now)
- Superconductor (turns Railgun into a fully automatic weapon)
- Railgun Battery Pack (required to craft railgun, increase weapon durability, can stack more than one)
- Rapid Recharger (required to repair the railgun)
- Caseless Round (ammo for the railgun)

### MoreHealthMod

Changes Slow Metabolism perk to instead of slow food/water loss to give max health. Perk levels give 10, 33, 55, 87, 100 percent boost to max health. At level 10 fort you can have 400 hp. This is more important late game than eating and drinking.

### GoHungryMod

You will slowly lose food and water over time. The higher the level, the more food and water loss you sustain. Makes it so you actually have to eat and drink as the game progresses.
