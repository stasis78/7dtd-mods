This is a collection of very basic mods that I used to always apply by hand. Thanks to the awesome new xpath modlet system, I no longer need to do that!

## Mod Info

### AugerMod

Makes the auger one shot stone after you get some strength and/or miner69 perks. Increases wood damage so you can 1-2 shot trees. Also increases the gas tank to a reasonable size.

### AugerNoKickMod

Removes kickback from auger.

### ShutUpAugerMod

This just replaces the loud parts of the auger with a quiet sound. The idle sound is still there which isn't annoying. Probably breaks a lot of the sound based heat map stuff...

### TripleThreatPointMod

3 points for perks per level.

### StackSizeMod

Stack size changes/remaps the following:

- 1000 -> 10,000 (i.e. gas cans)
- 6000 -> 10,000 (i.e. wood stacks)
- iron frags -> 10,000

### MoreStrippersMod

Add more strippers to some of the game. You will see them more often. :lulz:

### WeedwhackerMod

Its just a stone axe that attacks really fast and far away...

### FlatWorldMod 

Not really a completely flat world. It just makes things "a bit more flat".

### StoneResourcesMod

Gives brass, lead, oil shale, potassium, and coal from stone blocks.

### StrongerSteelMod

Make steel lighter and stronger. Still can't overcome the 15 block SI limit..

### FasterMovementMod

You'll move really really fast now.

### MostExcellentStartMod

Start with: auger, chainsaw, machete! and some other stuff.

### WhatTheHayMod

Infinite fall height onto hay bale with no damage.

### ThreadMasterMod

Adds recipes for existing items to the game. Contains examples of how to require a crafting tool or crafting area for these recipes.

### ChainsawMod

Increase damage to wood. Double wood harvest amount. Massive increase to entity damage. Saw up those zeds.

### SteelGarageDoorMod

Adds a new steel tier to garage door with 3 levels, just like the iron version. Simply build a regular metal garage door and upgrade it. Inherits the Msteel material so it is very strong like the vault doors and stuff.

### PickupSeedsMod

Lets you pick up seeds, instead of punching them on accident. 

### BetterHoeMod 

Made to compliment PickupSeedsMod. The hoe now has a much smaller attack range, but attacks much faster. With this change you can simply walk along with left mouse button down, and harvest crops without damaging the soil.

When used with PickupSeedsMod, you never have to worry about seeds being removed :)
