This is a collection of very basic mods that I used to always apply by hand. Thanks to the awesome new xpath modlet system, I no longer need to do that!

## Mod Info

### AugerMod

Makes the auger one shot stone after you get some strength and/or miner69 perks. Increases wood damage so you can 1-2 shot trees. Also increases the gas tank to a reasonable size.

### AugerNoKickMod

Removes kickback from auger.

### ShutUpAugerMod

This just replaces the loud parts of the auger with a quiet sound. The idle sound is still there which isn't annoying. Probably breaks a lot of the sound based heat map stuff...

### TripleThreatPointMod

3 points for perks per level.

### StackSizeMod

Stack size changes/remaps the following:

- 1000 -> 10,000 (i.e. gas cans)
- 6000 -> 10,000 (i.e. wood stacks)
- iron frags -> 10,000

### MoreStrippersMod

Add more strippers to some of the game. You will see them more often. :lulz:

### WeedwhackerMod

Its just a stone axe that attacks really fast and far away...

### FlatWorldMod 

Not really a completely flat world. It just makes things "a bit more flat".

### StoneResourcesMod

Gives brass, lead, oil shale, potassium, and coal from stone blocks.

### StrongerSteelMod

Make steel lighter and stronger. Still can't overcome the 15 block SI limit..

### MostExcellentStartMod

Start with: auger, chainsaw, machete! and some other stuff.
